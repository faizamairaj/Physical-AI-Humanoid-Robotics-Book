# Isaac AI-Robot Brain Module

## Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to NVIDIA Isaac, a powerful platform for developing AI-powered robots. The Isaac ecosystem consists of three core components that work together to create intelligent robotic systems:

1. **Isaac Sim** - For photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. **Isaac ROS** - For perception, navigation, and manipulation using GPU-accelerated algorithms
3. **Nav2** - For advanced path planning and navigation execution

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, students will be able to:

- Understand the distinct roles of Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 in the AI-robot brain architecture
- Set up reproducible workflows compatible with standard Isaac installations
- Create simulation environments and generate synthetic data for robot perception training
- Configure perception pipelines using VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Implement path planning for humanoid robots using Nav2

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with ROS (Robot Operating System) fundamentals
- Access to a system compatible with NVIDIA Isaac installation

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main user stories, each focusing on a key component of the Isaac ecosystem:

- **User Story 1**: Isaac Sim Basics - Simulation & Synthetic Data
- **User Story 2**: Isaac ROS - VSLAM + Perception Pipelines
- **User Story 3**: Nav2 Path Planning for Humanoid Robots

Each section builds upon the previous one, but can also be studied independently for specific learning objectives.
